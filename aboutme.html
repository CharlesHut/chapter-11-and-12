     <p class="aboutp">Hi Im Charlie Hutchings and heres a short about me. I love to play video games
        and I love to watch anime as well. I also ride dirtbikes as well as golf a lot as well.
        and for pets ive had the same 2 dogs for almost my whole and they are toy poodles.
        and so far what I enjoy about web devlopement is learning about coding I find
        it to be very interesting and fun. I love being able to code something and seeing 
        what it turns out to be.
